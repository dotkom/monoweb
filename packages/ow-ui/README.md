## Dotkom's Design system (DD)

Dotkom's design system consists of multiple core components to be used across our application. It is primarily written in React and Tailwindcss

### Icons

We primarily use ![Iconify](https://docs.iconify.design/iconify-icon/react.html) for icons. The main icon style is ![Tabler](https://icon-sets.iconify.design/tabler/)
