# Job module

## How to add a new job

1. Add a new entry in `JobName` enum in `/packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma` and create a new migration
2. Create a new file `./payload/<job_name>.ts` and add:
    - A zod schema for validating the job payload
    - A function that parses the payload with the schema
    - Add this schema and parser to the `payloadHandlers` object in `./payload/index.ts`
3. Add a case for the job in the switch statement in `JobExecutor#executeAllProcessableJobs`
4. Add a new private method in `JobExecutor` that handles the job logic. Add any necessary services to the constructor of `JobExecutor` if needed
5. Add a method in `JobService` to schedule a job of the new type

Then you can use the JobService in your other service to create new jobs with the new job name, and they will be processed automatically.
