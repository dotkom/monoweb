// TODO: This is a leak in the separation of concerns. This is currently just so the next-auth callbacks can create a
//       user without requiring the entire app to depend on all of the core dependencies. Ideally, the next-auth code
//       should not be responsible for creating a user, but instead be done through an Auth0 event trigger.
