# Code owner file for Monoweb.

# We don't take this very seriously, but they are really useful for making
# GitHub auto-assign reviewers to PRs. It makes it easier for contributors to
# get pull requests reviewed.
#
# Another goal is also that people who have more experience with certain parts
# of the codebase get the responsibility to review patches that touch these
# parts.


# Until we have more defined responsibilities, I'll take ownership of code that
# is not covered by other, because I know every part of the codebase well.
